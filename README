== Data_Mining
QUESTIONS:
1. Maybe we shouldn't use strings with capital letters?
2. We need array of normalization constants?
3. Do we have any missing values? (if we dont't have then our computations is much easier)

DECISIONS:
1. Types of attributes should be accessible only by their name.
2. Array of normalization constants made.
You should document your project here.
